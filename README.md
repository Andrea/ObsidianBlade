ObsidianBlade - A Color scheme for IntellJ IDEA
-----------------------------------------------

![ObsidianBlade - Obsidian based color scheme](https://raw2.github.com/staslev/ObsidianBlade/master/colors/color-scheme.png "ObsidianBlade")

**ObsidianBlade** is a spin off the classic [Obsidian] (http://ideacolorthemes.org/themes/2/) the source of which I actually wanted to fork, but couldn't quite find the repo. Anyhow, thanks Morinar!

ObsidianBlade introduces a fine-grained semantic color coding that's allows one to easily differentiate semantic constructs with a glimpse of an eye. Class memebers, method parameters, local variables have their own colors, making code both pretty and easy to read.

**ObsidianBlade-DraculaFriendly** is basically ObsidianBlade with some minor environmental changes that make it suitable for use with IntelliJ's built in Dracula theme.


To import the color scheme:
==========================

1.  Download and extract the sources (ZIP file).
2.  Run <code>jar cfM settings.jar options colors 'IntelliJ IDEA Global Settings'</code>
3.  From IntelliJ, go to <code>File</code> then <code>Import Settings</code> and specify the <code>settings.jar</code> file you've just created.
